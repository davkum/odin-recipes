# odin-recipes
i just started learning HTML 
and i think it is prety nice
I just regret not learning such fun a very long time ago.
This is a little project I am building
Itâ€™s time to put all of the HTML knowledge i have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, i am  going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
